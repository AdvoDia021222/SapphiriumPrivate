# Main Factions
`Crimson Agate` - The faction created a software virus called «Bloodrage». Faction technologies use it to effectively crack down on enemy units. Ruby is the main source of their powers.
<br>
<br>`Indigo` - The faction that created the most powerful refrigerant at the moment is Ledonite. The faction effectively uses frosty weapons, forcing the enemy forces to freeze in place and be broken into many pieces. 
<br>
<br>`Golden Thread` - The holy faction representing peace, harmony, pacification. In their weapons, they use sacred fire, which carries particles of gold dust, which makes enemies heavier, forcing them to move slower, but at the same time they become stronger, as elements of gold are melted into their cases.
<br>
<br>`Beam` - A faction developed in electricity that has created and put into circulation resources containing high-energy components to create advanced electrical technologies.
<br>
<br>`Dart` - A faction of the standard armament, but with a small feature. Its weapons are equipped with dart-like bullets capable of piercing enemy targets, and can also be high-speed. Higher-level weapons are switching to the use of homing strike missiles.
<br>
<br>`Sandbank` - The faction uses an ancient type of structures in the form of siege engines, making ammunition for them from coal, stones and sand. Coal increases the flammability, stone causes severe damage from impact, sand covers the enemies.
